# ContextCraftPro

**ContextCraftPro (CCP)** is a self-contained, disposable Python tool that enables structured context engineering for AI-driven development.

## What is it?

ContextCraftPro helps you:

- **Define features** with structured specifications
- **Generate PRPs** (Product Requirements Prompts) that guide AI coding assistants
- **Validate implementations** against requirements
- **Maintain context health** and track completeness

All operations are **local-only** using Foundry Local. The entire tool lives in `ContextCraftPro/` and is **entirely disposable**—delete it anytime without affecting your project.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ContextCraftPro
pip install -r requirements.txt
